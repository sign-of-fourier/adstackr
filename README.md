# AdStackr
-Automates Dynamic Content Optimization (DCO)
Most ad stacks already automate bidding, targeting, and budgeting.[^1]
But when it comes to turning creative insights into what to do next, that’s still a manual, subjective process — which doesn’t scale when you’re managing hundreds of ads across multiple campaigns.[^2][^3][^4]
AdStackr automates that step, so you get data-driven decisions and better ads live faster, even as your creative footprint grows.[^2][^1]
